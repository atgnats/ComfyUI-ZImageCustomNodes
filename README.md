**Z-Image Power Nodes** is a collection of nodes designed specifically for the [Z-Image / Z-Image Turbo model](https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image). They are based on some ideas and discoveries I made while developing the [Amazing Z-Image Workflow](https://github.com/martin-rizzo/AmazingZImageWorkflow).

❤️ If you find these nodes useful or they’ve helped you in your projects, please consider supporting my work.
Your support allows me to continue researching and creating new developments within the open source community.  
There are several ways to do so:
  - **Give the repository a star:** if we reach 500 stars, big things could happen!
  - **Ko-fi:** [https://ko-fi.com/martinrizzo](https://ko-fi.com/martinrizzo)

*Every contribution, no matter how small, is greatly appreciated! Thank you.*

## Nodes

* __[⚡Z-Sampler Turbo](docs/zsampler_turbo.md)__  
<sub>A specialized sampler designed to Z-Image Turbo that achieves sufficient quality to eliminate the need for further post-processing.</sub>
* __[⚡Style Prompt Encoder](docs/style_prompt_encoder.md)__  
<sub>Applies a selected visual styles to your prompt and encodes both of them using a text-encoder model (clip).
* __[⚡Style String Injector](docs/style_string_injector.md)__  
<sub>Seamlessly integrates a chosen style into your prompt text. It accepts a string as input and modifies it based on the selected style.</sub>
* __[⚡My Top-10 Styles](docs/my_top_10_styles.md)__  
<sub>Allows you to create a list of favorite styles for quick selection of your most used ones.</sub>
* __[⚡VAE Encode (for Soft Inpainting)](docs/vae_encode_for_soft_inpainting.md)__  
<sub>Encodes images into a latent representation, embedding the mask that indicates where inpainting will be applied.</sub>
* __[⚡Save Image](docs/save_image.md)__  
<sub>Saves generated images with the option to embed CivitAI-compatible metadata, making it easy to share generation parameters through that platform.</sub>
* __[⚡Empty Z-Image Latent Image](docs/empty_zimage_latent_image.md)__  
<sub>Creates an empty latent image of the appropriate size for Z-Image, selecting aspect ratio, scale, and orientation.</sub>


## Examples

[__/workflows__](/workflows)  
This folder contains reference workflows demonstrating the use of the Power Nodes across various tasks.
These are simple yet powerful examples that serve as an excellent resource for understanding how to utilize
each node.

[__/styles/samples_wf__](/styles/samples_wf)  
This folder includes all the workflows used to generate the thumbnail images in the styles gallery.

[__Z-Image Power Nodes on CivitAI__](https://civitai.com/models/2322533)  
Explore hundreds of images generated using the Z-Image model and the Power Nodes. Images posted by me
come with their prompts and complete generation workflows, which you can freely use as a starting point
for your own generations. Additionally, many users share their amazing creations in this community.

Each image features a sidebar information panel. To easily extract the workflow from an image, click on
the "COMFY: X Nodes" button located within the "Other metadata" section of the panel. You can then press
CTRL+V (paste) directly into ComfyUI to obtain the full workflow for your own projects or generations.

## Installation
_Ensure you have the latest version of [ComfyUi](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)._

### Installation via ComfyUI Manager (Recommended)

The easiest way to install the nodes is through [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager):

  1. Open ComfyUI and click on the "Manager" button to launch the "ComfyUI Manager Menu".
  2. Within the ComfyUI Manager, locate and click on the "Custom Nodes Manager" button.
  3. In the search bar, type "Z-Image Power Nodes".
  4. Select the option from the search results and click the "Install" button.
  5. Restart ComfyUI to ensure the changes take effect.

### Manual Installation

.

1. Open your preferred terminal application.
2. Navigate to your ComfyUI directory:
   ```bash
   cd <your_comfyui_directory>
   ```
3. Move into the **custom_nodes** folder and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   cd custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/martin-rizzo/ComfyUI-ZImagePowerNodes.git
   ```

.

1. Go to where you unpacked **ComfyUI_windows_portable**,  
   you'll find your `run_nvidia_gpu.bat` file here, confirming the correct location.
3. Press **CTRL + SHIFT + RightClick** in an empty space and select "Open PowerShell window here".
4. Clone the repository into your custom nodes folder using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/martin-rizzo/ComfyUI-ZImagePowerNodes .\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-ZImagePowerNodes
   ```

## Recommended Checkpoints

### GGUF Format

<sub>GGUF checkpoints tend to run slightly slower in ComfyUI. However, if you are building a complex workflow that involves other models or using heavy LLMs with ollama, GGUF files can help prevent system freezes and OOM errors during generation, especially when VRAM is limited. For simple image generation workflows, a safetensors file (though heavier) might be preferable. When working with GGUF in Z-Image, from my experience, using the Q5_K_S quantization typically offers the best balance between file size and prompt response. </sub>

Note: ComfyUI does not natively support GGUF format, so you need to install the [ComfyUI-GGUF](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF) nodes.

### Safetensors Format

<sub>Safetensors files are generally larger, but ComfyUI includes several built-in optimizations to speed up generation even with limited VRAM. It's always a good idea to test the original safetensors checkpoints on your system to see how they perform. However, using safetensors in fp8 format is strongly discouraged as it can significantly reduce quality. If you have an RTX 50 series GPU based on Blackwell architecture, NVFP4 quantized safetensors could be a better choice.</sub>
